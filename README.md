# Unreal Essential Materials

This Unreal Project contains a selection of Materials and Material Functions that can be used for most if not all surfaces.

I've been building this collection as I go along making and creating new materials so it will be further updated and improved. My aim for this material set is not to create specific material types, such as sandstone or flint, but to create base templates that can be used to create any specific materials (although what defines this can be a grey line at times!).

Please do contribute (fork) if you can see where improvements or new additions can be made. But please note the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/motionforge/Unreal_Essential_Materials/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines). Mainly keep file sizes as low as possible, use only creative commons assets if necessary, and try to stick to master material templates.

It comes with a set of textures that are all in creative commons and downloaded from:

**List of Materials:**

* Simple - Colour/Color Base.
* Standard - A little more advanced with Colour/Rough/Normal and a switch for using a diffuse texture or just a base colour.
* Bump - Standard material with a height map.
* Parralax Occulation - A more advanced height map material. Similar to bump, better look, but more demanding of system resources. 
* Displacement - Displaces the mesh. 
* Opacity - Parts of the material are transparent or hidden.
* Cloth
* Emissive
* Metallic
* Glass
* Frosted Glass
* Distorted Glass
* Water
* Slimy Water
* Carbon Fibre
* Clear Coat
* Clear Coat - No Bottom
* Parameter collection example
* Curtain wind animation material - Doesn't just have to be a curtain - but best with cloth and flexible meshes.
* Ground
* Master Material - Most of the materials here can be made from this material if required.
* Vertex Painted Material
* Material Functions Example
* Masked and two sided foliage material
* Wheat Field with noise texture to create a wind effect
